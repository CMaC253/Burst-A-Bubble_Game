<h1>Important Notes:</h1>
<ul>
<li>
Make sure to read the homework assignment, in order to be clear on your two tasks (implementing the Fireworks class, and randomizing the placement of the Bubbles).  If you have questions on how the Fireworks class should behave, try running the SampleSolution.exe (note that the solution does NOT randomize the placement of the bubbles)
</li>
<li>The program starts in the Program.cs file.  Main simply creates an instance of 'BurstABubble', which is where all the actual game logic is.  Almost all the other classes mostly just collect up data & methods into nice little bins so it's easier to see how everything connects together.</li>

<li>Since your main job is to implement the 'Fireworks' class, which derrives from Projectile, you should probably look at something similar, like the basic Rock class.  Use the Rock class as a guide for what you should implement.</li>

<li>Since your other job is to randomize the placement of the Bubbles, you'll need to find where they're created.  Try using the "Find/Search" feature in Visual Studio to look for the phrase "new Bubble" (or something similar) to figure out where the Bubbles are created.</li>
</ul>
